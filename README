This is the repository for creating the special editions of Swift Linux.

Each special edition is regular Swift Linux with an audio clip that plays at startup and special wallpaper for LightDM and the ROX desktop.

PREREQUISITE: You are in your VirtualBox installation of LMDE and have downloaded all of the 
repositories you need through the ~/develop/1-build/preinstall.sh script.

The steps to create a special edition of Swift Linux on the desktop are:
1.  If you haven't already done so, enter the command "sudo sh ~/develop/1-build/desktop-regular.sh".  
(This transforms LMDE into Regular Swift Linux on your desktop setup.)
2.  Enter the command "sudo python ~/develop/special/shared.py abbrev fullname"
where abbrev = the abbreviation of the special edition and
fullname = the full name of the special edition
